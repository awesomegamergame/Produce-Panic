# Description

Get ready for a Produce Panic! 

In this fast-paced and addictive 2D game, your goal is to catch as many fruits and vegetables as possible as they rain down from the sky. 

Use your basket to catch the produce before it hits the ground, but be careful not to drop any or you'll lose a life.

 With three lives at your disposal, see how long you can survive as the produce rain down faster and faster. 

With simple one-touch controls and colorful graphics, Produce Panic is the perfect game to pass the time and challenge your reflexes. 

So what are you waiting for? Let the produce rain down and see how many points you can score!
